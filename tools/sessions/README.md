# Sessions Tool

Browse and search conversation history. An agent can list its past sessions, read full message histories, and search across sessions by pattern.

Access is strictly scoped to the calling agent — an agent cannot read another agent's sessions.

## Default Configuration

No configuration needed. The tool works out of the box with no config block. All commands (`list`, `get`, `grep`) are always available.

## Security Model

| Concern | How it is handled |
|---|---|
| **Agent scoping** | Every operation is filtered to the calling agent's sessions. Agent name comes from `BEIGE_AGENT_NAME` (injected by beige ≥ 0.1.3). |
| **Ownership check** | Before reading any session, the tool verifies the session belongs to the caller. |
| **No cross-agent access** | There is no config option to allow reading another agent's sessions. |
| **Read-only** | The tool never writes, modifies, or deletes sessions. |
| **No raw file paths** | File paths are never exposed in output — only session keys and message content. |

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `list` | List sessions (newest first). Tool-initiated sessions excluded by default. |
| `get <key>` | Full message history of a session. Truncated at 50 messages by default. |
| `grep <pattern>` | Search message content across sessions. |

## JSON Output

All commands accept `--format json` for structured output suitable for scripting or further processing.

## Error Reference

| Error | Cause |
|---|---|
| `agent identity unknown` | `BEIGE_AGENT_NAME` not set — requires beige ≥ 0.1.3 |
| `session store unavailable` | Tool not running in gateway context |
| `session 'X' not found` | Key not in the session map |
| `Permission denied: session 'X' belongs to agent 'Y'` | Session exists but owned by a different agent |
| `Invalid regex 'X'` | `/pattern/` syntax used but the regex is malformed |

## Implementation Details

- **Target**: Gateway (runs on the host, not in the sandbox)
- **Read-only**: Never writes, modifies, or deletes sessions
- **No dependencies**: Uses beige's internal session store
