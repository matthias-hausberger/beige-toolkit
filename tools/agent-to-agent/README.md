# Agent-to-Agent Tool

Invoke another Beige agent and hold a multi-turn conversation with it. Every call returns the target agent's full response plus a **session key** you can pass back via `--session` to continue the same conversation.

Sub-agent calls (an agent calling itself) work identically — include the agent's own name in its `allowedTargets` list.

## Default Configuration

**Default deny** — no calls are permitted unless `allowedTargets` is explicitly configured. Installing the tool changes nothing until you opt in.

## Configuration

```json5
tools: {
  "agent-to-agent": {
    path: "~/.beige/toolkits/beige-toolkit/tools/agent-to-agent",
    target: "gateway",
    config: {
      // Which agents may call which other agents.
      // Absent entirely → no agent-to-agent calls are permitted.
      allowedTargets: {
        coder:    ["reviewer", "coder"],   // coder can call reviewer and itself
        reviewer: ["coder"],               // reviewer can call coder
      },

      // Maximum nesting depth. Default: 1.
      maxDepth: 1,
    },
  },
},

agents: {
  coder: {
    tools: ["agent-to-agent"],
  },
  reviewer: {
    tools: ["agent-to-agent"],
  },
},
```

### Depth Limiting

| `maxDepth` | What is allowed |
|---|---|
| `0` | No agent-to-agent calls at all, even if `allowedTargets` is set |
| `1` *(default)* | Agents may call agents; sub-agents may **not** call further agents |
| `2` | Two levels of nesting; agents at depth 2 may not call further agents |

## Security Model

| Concern | How it is handled |
|---|---|
| **Default deny** | No calls permitted unless `allowedTargets` is configured. |
| **Per-caller whitelisting** | Each caller has its own target list. A→B does not imply B→A. |
| **Depth cap** | `maxDepth` prevents runaway recursive calls. |
| **Unknown targets** | Calls to non-existent agents are rejected immediately. |
| **Session integrity** | Resuming a session with a mismatched `--target` is rejected. |

## Error Reference

| Error | Cause |
|---|---|
| `--target <agent> is required` | No `--target` flag provided and `--info` not used |
| `No allowedTargets configured` | Config has no `allowedTargets` key |
| `Agent 'X' is not permitted to call agent 'Y'` | Caller not allowed to call this target |
| `Agent call depth limit reached` | Session is at `maxDepth` |
| `Unknown agent 'X'` | Target not defined in beige config |
| `Session 'X' not found` | `--session` key doesn't exist |
| `Session 'X' belongs to agent 'Y'` | Session was created for a different target |
| `No message provided` | No message text or file given |

## Implementation Details

- **Target**: Gateway (runs on the host, not in the sandbox)
- **No dependencies**: Uses beige's internal agent manager
- **Session persistence**: Sessions persist across gateway restarts in `~/.beige/sessions/`
