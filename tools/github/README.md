# GitHub Tool

Interact with GitHub using the [`gh` CLI](https://cli.github.com/). Routes all commands to `gh` running on the gateway host — authentication is managed by `gh` itself, no token configuration needed in Beige. Repository deletion (`repo delete`) is permanently blocked regardless of configuration.

## Installation

Install this tool individually:

```bash
beige tools install github:matthias-hausberger/beige-toolkit/tools/github
```

Or install all tools from the toolkit:

```bash
# From npm
beige tools install npm:@matthias-hausberger/beige-toolkit

# From GitHub
beige tools install github:matthias-hausberger/beige-toolkit
```

## Configuration

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `allowedCommands` | all commands except `api` | Whitelist of top-level `gh` subcommands (e.g. `"repo"`, `"issue"`, `"pr"`). Set explicitly to include `"api"` for raw API access. |
| `deniedCommands` | *(none)* | Blacklist of top-level `gh` subcommands. Always blocked, even if in `allowedCommands`. Deny beats allow. |

All `gh` subcommands are permitted by default **except `api`**, which is excluded because it allows arbitrary HTTP methods and GraphQL mutations. When `allowedCommands` is set explicitly, it fully replaces the default list.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| `gh` CLI | Must be installed on the **gateway host** ([install guide](https://cli.github.com/)) |
| Authentication | Run `gh auth login` on the host before starting Beige |

The tool inherits the gateway process's environment, so `gh` picks up `~/.config/gh/` automatically.

## Config Examples

**Read-only agent** (list and view, no mutations):
```json5
config: {
  allowedCommands: ["repo", "issue", "pr", "release", "run", "api"],
  deniedCommands: [],
}
```

**Issue triage bot** (issues only):
```json5
config: {
  allowedCommands: ["issue"],
}
```

**Enable raw API access** alongside standard commands:
```json5
config: {
  allowedCommands: ["repo", "issue", "pr", "api"],
}
```

### Per-Agent Configuration (toolConfigs)

Use beige's `toolConfigs` to give different agents different GitHub permissions:

```json5
tools: {
  github: {
    config: {
      // Baseline: standard commands, no API access
      allowedCommands: ["repo", "issue", "pr", "release", "run"],
    },
  },
},

agents: {
  // Triage bot — issues only
  triage: {
    tools: ["github"],
    toolConfigs: {
      github: {
        allowedCommands: ["issue"],
      },
    },
  },

  // DevOps agent — full access including API
  devops: {
    tools: ["github"],
    toolConfigs: {
      github: {
        allowedCommands: ["repo", "issue", "pr", "release", "run", "api"],
      },
    },
  },

  // Default agent — uses baseline config as-is
  assistant: {
    tools: ["github"],
  },
},
```

## Error Reference

| Error | Cause |
|---|---|
| `Permission denied: subcommand 'X' is not allowed` | Subcommand blocked by allow/deny config |
| `Permission denied: 'repo delete' is permanently blocked` | Repository deletion is always blocked |
| Command fails with `gh` error | `gh` is not installed or not authenticated on the gateway host |

## Implementation Details

- **Target**: Gateway (runs on the host, not in the sandbox)
- **Dependency**: `gh` CLI
- **Stateless**: Each invocation spawns a fresh `gh` process
