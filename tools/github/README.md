# GitHub Tool

Interact with GitHub using the [`gh` CLI](https://cli.github.com/). Routes all commands to `gh` running on the gateway host. Repository deletion (`repo delete`) is permanently blocked regardless of configuration.

## Installation

Install this tool individually:

```bash
beige tools install github:matthias-hausberger/beige-toolkit/tools/github
```

Or install all tools from the toolkit:

```bash
# From npm
beige tools install npm:@matthias-hausberger/beige-toolkit

# From GitHub
beige tools install github:matthias-hausberger/beige-toolkit
```

## Configuration

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `token` | *(none)* | GitHub token for authentication. Passed to `gh` via `GH_TOKEN`. Accepts classic PATs (`ghp_…`) and fine-grained PATs (`github_pat_…`). When absent, `gh` uses its locally stored auth. |
| `allowedCommands` | all commands except `api` | Whitelist of top-level `gh` subcommands (e.g. `"repo"`, `"issue"`, `"pr"`). Set explicitly to include `"api"` for raw API access. |
| `deniedCommands` | *(none)* | Blacklist of top-level `gh` subcommands. Always blocked, even if in `allowedCommands`. Deny beats allow. |

All `gh` subcommands are permitted by default **except `api`**, which is excluded because it allows arbitrary HTTP methods and GraphQL mutations. When `allowedCommands` is set explicitly, it fully replaces the default list.

## Authentication

The tool supports two authentication modes:

**Token in config (recommended for multi-agent setups)**

Set `token` in the agent's `toolConfigs`. The token is forwarded to `gh` via `GH_TOKEN` and takes precedence over any credential stored on the host, so different agents can authenticate as different GitHub identities.

Both token formats work without any special configuration:
- Classic personal access tokens: `ghp_…`
- Fine-grained personal access tokens: `github_pat_…`

```json5
toolConfigs: {
  github: {
    token: "ghp_yourPersonalAccessToken",
  },
},
```

**Host-level auth (zero config)**

When no `token` is configured, the tool inherits the gateway process's environment and `gh` picks up whatever auth is already present on the host (`~/.config/gh/`, `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var, etc.). Run `gh auth login` on the host once, and all agents without an explicit token will share that credential.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| `gh` CLI | Must be installed on the **gateway host** ([install guide](https://cli.github.com/)) |
| Authentication | Either set `token` in config, or run `gh auth login` on the host |

## Config Examples

**Agent with its own token:**
```json5
{
  tools: {
    github: {
      config: {
        token: "ghp_yourPersonalAccessToken",
        allowedCommands: ["repo", "issue", "pr"],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

**Read-only agent** (list and view, no mutations):
```json5
{
  tools: {
    github: {
      config: {
        allowedCommands: ["repo", "issue", "pr", "release", "run"],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

**Issue triage bot** (issues only):
```json5
{
  tools: {
    github: {
      config: {
        allowedCommands: ["issue"],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

**Enable raw API access** alongside standard commands:
```json5
{
  tools: {
    github: {
      config: {
        allowedCommands: ["repo", "issue", "pr", "api"],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Per-Agent Configuration (toolConfigs)

Use beige's `toolConfigs` to give different agents different GitHub tokens and permissions:

```json5
tools: {
  github: {
    config: {
      // Baseline: standard commands, no API access
      allowedCommands: ["repo", "issue", "pr", "release", "run"],
    },
  },
},

agents: {
  // Triage bot — issues only, dedicated read-only PAT
  triage: {
    tools: ["github"],
    toolConfigs: {
      github: {
        token: "ghp_readOnlyTriageToken",
        allowedCommands: ["issue"],
      },
    },
  },

  // DevOps agent — full access including API, own fine-grained PAT
  devops: {
    tools: ["github"],
    toolConfigs: {
      github: {
        token: "github_pat_11AABBCC_devopsToken",
        allowedCommands: ["repo", "issue", "pr", "release", "run", "api"],
      },
    },
  },

  // Default agent — uses baseline config and host-level gh auth
  assistant: {
    tools: ["github"],
  },
},
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No commits between main and feature-branch"

**Cause:** The branch doesn't exist on the remote yet. PR creation requires the branch to be pushed first.

**Fix:** Push the branch before creating the PR:
```sh
git push origin feature-branch
gh pr create --repo owner/repo --title "..." --body "..."
```

### Permission Denied on Push

**Cause:** Your SSH deploy key doesn't have write access to the repository.

**Fix:** Use the fork workflow:
1. Fork the repository to your account
2. Add the fork as a git remote: `git remote add fork git@github.com:your-username/repo.git`
3. Push to your fork: `git push fork feature-branch`
4. Create PR from fork: `gh pr create --repo upstream/repo --head your-username:feature-branch`

### GraphQL Requires 'read:org' Scope

**Cause:** Some `gh` commands (like `pr view` with certain fields) require the `read:org` scope.

**Fix:** Update the GitHub token to include `read:org` scope, or use alternative commands that don't require it.

## Error Reference

| Error | Cause |
|---|---|
| `Permission denied: subcommand 'X' is not allowed` | Subcommand blocked by allow/deny config |
| `Permission denied: 'repo delete' is permanently blocked` | Repository deletion is always blocked |
| `No commits between X and Y` | Branch not pushed to remote |
| `Head sha can't be blank` | Branch not pushed to remote |
| Command fails with `gh` error | `gh` is not installed or not authenticated on the gateway host |

## Implementation Details

- **Target**: Gateway (runs on the host, not in the sandbox)
- **Dependency**: `gh` CLI
- **Stateless**: Each invocation spawns a fresh `gh` process
- **Token precedence**: `config.token` → `GH_TOKEN` → host `~/.config/gh/`
