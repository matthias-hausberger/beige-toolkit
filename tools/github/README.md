# GitHub Tool

Interact with GitHub using the [`gh` CLI](https://cli.github.com/). The tool routes all commands to `gh` running on the gateway host — no token configuration is needed inside Beige; authentication is managed by `gh` itself.

Supports the full `gh` command surface: repositories, issues, pull requests, releases, workflow runs, and raw API access.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| `gh` CLI | Must be installed on the **gateway host** ([install guide](https://cli.github.com/)) |
| Authentication | Run `gh auth login` on the host before starting Beige |

The tool inherits the gateway process's environment, so `gh` picks up `~/.config/gh/` automatically. No GitHub token is stored in Beige config.

## Default Configuration

Out of the box, all `gh` subcommands are permitted **except `api`**. The `api` subcommand is excluded by default because it allows arbitrary HTTP methods and GraphQL mutations against any GitHub endpoint. Repository deletion (`repo delete`) is permanently blocked regardless of configuration.

## Access Control

Restrict which top-level `gh` subcommands an agent may use via `config`:

| Config field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `allowedCommands` | `string \| string[]` | all commands except `api` | Only these subcommands are permitted. |
| `deniedCommands` | `string \| string[]` | *(none)* | Always blocked. Deny beats allow. |

### Examples

**Read-only agent** (list and view, no mutations):
```json5
config: {
  allowedCommands: ["repo", "issue", "pr", "release", "run", "api"],
  deniedCommands: [],
}
```

**Issue triage bot** (issues only):
```json5
config: {
  allowedCommands: ["issue"],
}
```

**Enable raw API access** alongside standard commands:
```json5
config: {
  allowedCommands: ["repo", "issue", "pr", "api"],
}
```

## Setup

Add to your agent in `config.json5`:

```json5
tools: {
  github: {
    path: "~/.beige/toolkits/beige-toolkit/tools/github",
    target: "gateway",
  },
},
agents: {
  assistant: {
    tools: ["github"],
  },
}
```

## Error Reference

| Error | Cause |
|---|---|
| `Permission denied: subcommand 'X' is not allowed` | Subcommand blocked by allow/deny config |
| Command fails with `gh` error | `gh` is not installed or not authenticated on the gateway host |

## Implementation Details

- **Target**: Gateway (runs on the host, not in the sandbox)
- **Dependency**: `gh` CLI
- **Protocol**: Tool launcher calls back to gateway via Unix socket
- **Stateless**: Each invocation spawns a fresh `gh` process
